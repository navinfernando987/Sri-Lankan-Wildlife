Renowned for its diverse ecosystem and scenic landscapes, Wilpattu is the largest national park in the country, covering an extensive area of approximately 1,317 square kilometers. The park is characterized by its unique mix of natural habitats, including dense scrublands, open grassy plains, and pristine lakes. One of its distinctive features is the presence of "villus," or natural lakes, which attract a rich variety of wildlife.</p>

In addition to leopards, the park is home to various other species such as elephants, sloth bears, spotted deer, crocodiles, and a diverse array of bird species. The park's relatively undisturbed environment provides a valuable haven for these creatures, contributing to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.</p>
                        <br>
